This extension allows registered users to have multiple shipping & billing addresses and select each of them on checkout.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_address_book', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_address_book', branch: 'X-X-stable'
  ```

  The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
  For example, use `3-0-stable` if you're using Spree `3-0-stable` or any `3.0.x` version.

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_address_book:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.
